My day starts at 7 o’clock. I take a shower, wash my face, brush my teeth and get dressed. After that I have breakfast. Then I take a school bus and go to school.

Lessons start at 8 o’clock. The first lesson is Mathematics. We study numbers and figures. It’s boring, but the teacher is very kind and funny. The next lesson is Literature. We read books for children. My favourite book is Alice in Wonderland.

The third lesson is History. There we study history of the world. It is interesting, because you can learn something new. I like to read about English kings and queens.

The fourth lesson is art. We draw and paint pictures. Sometimes we make New Year or Christmas cards. Our teacher helps us. Later I give pictures and cards to my parents.

On Tuesdays and Fridays we have Physical Education lessons. I like to do sports, run and jump. Boys usually play football, and I like to play it too! My father is a football coach, and now I am the best player in our team. Girls usually play volleyball or do aerobics. Sometimes we play catch-up together.

After school I go home by bus and do homework. I like my school, my teachers and friends.
