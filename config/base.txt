My family is a team! We are four in my family: my parents, my sister and me. We like to spend time together and play games.

My father’s name is John. He has green eyes and brown hair. He is a football trainer and plays football every day with his pupils. Football is popular in England. My father is kind, strong and active.

My mother Alice is a school teacher. She has blue eyes and blond hair. She likes children, that is why she is a school teacher. Her favourite subject is English. She likes to read books and walk with our dog. My mother is beautiful, calm and clever.

Lisa is my little sister. She is four years old. She can read simple books and draw funny pictures. I like how she dances to music on the radio. She dreams about magic animals.

On weekends we play active games in the park near our house. My father teaches us to play football, my mother tells stories from the books, and Lisa sings children’s songs and dances. I like to spend time with them, they love me, and I love them too! My family is the best!
