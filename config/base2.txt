Morning is my favourite part of the day. I like to make my morning interesting. Interesting morning means a good day!
I wake up at 7 o’clock and get up. I do some exercises – I turn, jump and sometimes go jogging.

Then, I go to the bathroom. I take a shower, brush my teeth and wash my face. I like this part of the morning because my toothpaste smells like oranges, and my soap smells like apples. I like oranges and apples.

After that I get dressed – I put on my pants, a T-shirt and a sweater. These are my school clothes, but I sometimes wear a tracksuit to school.

At 7:25 I go downstairs to the kitchen to have breakfast with my Mom and Dad. I usually have some oatmeal or a chicken sandwich. Sometimes I eat fried eggs with sausages and cheese. I like to drink tea in the morning. I also take my lunchbox to school. There is fruit, two sandwiches and a small bottle of juice.

At 7:45 I say good-bye to my parents, take my school bag and go outside. There is a school bus waiting for me. It picks me up, and I go to school, ready for a long and interesting school day.
