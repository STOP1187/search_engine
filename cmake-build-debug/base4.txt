Everyone has a friend! My friend’s name is Sarah. She lives not far away from me, so I often come to visit her. She has blue eyes, black hair and white skin – like a Snow White!

Sarah is my classmate. She is very smart and always gets good grades at school. She’s good at Maths and History, so she often helps me do my Maths homework. We also go to our school football club together. We sometimes play football after classes with other classmates.

One day when we went home from school she asked me to play video games with her. Sarah likes video games. She has a big collection. There are games about soldiers, princesses and animals. We played for 3 hours! It was so much fun! Sarah also plays chess. I don’t play chess well, but I’m learning.

Sarah is clever and kind, I like to talk to her. She is my best friend, and I’m her best friend, too.
