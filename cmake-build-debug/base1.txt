I like to be at home. It’s my happy place. It is a place where my family gets together.
We live in a two-storey house. Our living room is on the ground floor. There we sit, watch movies and play games. My little sister likes to play with her dolls there. I often find her toys under the table.

Next to the living room there is a kitchen and a dining room. We cook in the kitchen and eat in the dining room. Kitchen is my mother’s favourite place. She likes to cook soups and sandwiches. My father sometimes sits there in the armchair and reads books.

Our room and parents’ bedroom is on the first floor. There’s a bathroom next to our room. My sister and I have lots of toys in our room. There are many cars, dinosaurs and dolls. There is a computer on the table and a bookshelf in the corner. There are books about travelling and animals.

There’s our parents’ bedroom opposite our room. Their room is large with big windows. There’s a big bed, a wardrobe, a mirror and a bookshelf.

I like my home, it is a place to be happy and have fun!
